# Q Quadratic; current version: 1.0 (The GP and PARI guides are still V0.9, missing a few descriptions)
A PARI/GP package for integral binary quadratic forms and quaternion algebras over Q, with an emphasis on indefinite quadratic forms and indefinite quaternion algebras.

If you would like to use this package in GP, please consult the "QQuadratic_GP_guide", and download the files "libqquadratic.so", and "qquadratic.gp" only. Start GP by calling "gp qquadratic", or call "\r qquadratic" inside of GP to install the methods and the corresponding addhelp files. Note that this will ONLY work with Linux, or a program like "Windows Subsystem for Linux".

If you would like to use this package with PARI in library mode, please consult the "QQuadratic_PARI_guide".

As the package is still a work in progress, there are still important methods not yet implemented. Furthermore, the GP and PARI guides may be slightly outdated, i.e. missing the descriptions of currently implemented methods.
