# Q Quadratic; current version: 0.1
A PARI/GP package for integral binary quadratic forms (and coming soon: quaternion algebras) over Q, with an emphasis on indefinite quadratic forms (and coming soon: indefinite quaternion algebras).
Currently only the binary quadratic form methods have been implemented; the quaternion algebra methods should be ready by October 2020.

If you would like to use this package in GP, please consult the "Qquadratic_GP_guide", and download the files "libqquadratic.so", and "qquadratic.gp".

If you would like to use this package with PARI in library mode, please consult the "Qquadratic_PARI_guide"

If you plan on modifying these methods, you need the files "c_base.c", "c_bqf.c", and "qquadraticdecl.h"

If you plan on using and not moddifying these methods, you instead need "libqquadratic.so", "qquadraticdecl.h", and "qquadratic.gp".
